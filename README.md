# Memory Allocator

This project is an assignment for the course Operating Systems at University of Polytechnic Bucharest. The purpose of this project is to implement the malloc, free, realloc and calloc functions from the C standard library.

During the implementation of the memory allocator, I found the supplementary materials to be very helpful. I will list them at the end of this document.
